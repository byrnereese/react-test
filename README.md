# Tic-Tac-Toe React Game

I started this project to learn React following the instructions found at the following tutorial:

## Notes About What I Learned

It was exciting to see an app that refreshed itself seamlessly without me having to reload the page. That kind of responsiveness is relatively unique for the web and provided an eye-opening and refreshing developer experience. 

I also was pleasantly surprised by the experience of embedding HTML into my javascript. In past work I did so, but only after escaping quotation marks and other special characters, which made reading and writing HTML a pain. 

The real challenge however is the design paradigm. React strikes me as a framework that works really, really well, but only when really closely adhered to. If I managed a team of engineers, one concern I would have would be the learning curve - because not only do you have to learn the code base, but you have to relearn how to trace and read code according to a new paradigm.

## Recommended Tasks to Challenge Myself

* DONE: Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
* DONE: Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
* When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.


## Background
